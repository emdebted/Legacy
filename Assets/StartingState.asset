  storyText: You feel as if you are waiting between worlds, a fog surrounding your
    thoughts. Time passes, you think, though it feels off, as if your existence has
    slowed to a miasmatic crawl, your consciousness captive within a thick molasses.
    After a millenia, the void you've been pushing against is replaced by blurs of
    color, clarity drawing ever closer as your eyes open and attempt to make sense
    of the external world. Objects begin to come into focus; a broken stool, damp
    stonework, a small bookcase. Throbbing pain at the back of your head is also
    brought into focus, forcing you to wince with just enough time to realize what's
    coming before you double over from the dingy bedding you've been resting on and
    vomit onto the floor. After the coughs and sputters subside, you take a deep
    breath and sit up a little straighter, giving the room a better look over. The
    only light is coming from a candle burning low on the table opposite you, resting
    beside a small strongbox of some kind. The bookcase is totally empty, and sits
    pushed against the table. The walls are fairly solid stone, with a slow but steady
    drip of water falling from the stone ceiling onto the wooden floorboards. To
    your left is the exit, a door made of bars, through which the sound of distant
    running water can be heard. You stand with some effort, and just as you suspected,
    the door is locked. Where are you? Your head hurts immensely and you still feel
    disconnected from the world. The strongbox being the only notable item in the
    room, you make your way over to the table and attempt to open it, and the moment
    you lay hands on it you are met with a voice that seems to emanate from within
    your own skull. "Who are you?"
