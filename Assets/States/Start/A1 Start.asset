  storyText: 'You feel as if you are waiting between worlds, a fog surrounding your
    thoughts. Time passes, you think, though it feels off, as if your existence has
    slowed to a miasmatic crawl, your consciousness captive within a thick molasses.
    After a millennia, the void you''ve been pushing against is replaced by blurs
    of color, clarity drawing ever closer as your eyes open and attempt to make sense
    of the external world. Objects begin to come into focus; a broken stool, damp
    stonework, a small bookcase. Throbbing pain at the back of your head is also
    brought into focus, forcing you to wince with just enough time to realize what''s
    coming before you double over from the dingy bedding you''ve been resting on
    and vomit onto the floor. After the coughs and sputters subside, you take a deep
    breath and sit up a little straighter, giving the room a better look over. The
    only light is coming from a candle burning low on the table opposite you, resting
    beside a small strongbox of some kind. The bookcase is totally empty, and sits
    pushed against the table. The walls are fairly solid stone, with a slow but steady
    drip of water falling from the stone ceiling onto the wooden floorboards. To
    your left, however, is the most interesting sight of the room. The entire wall
    is missing, replaced with the wall of a cage, a small barred door to one side,
    through which the sound of distant running water can be heard. Beyond the bars
    you can see precious little, an ephemeral foggy darkness seems to surround your
    room, the view only allowing you to make out a few feet of ground beyond the
    doorway. You stand with some effort, and just as you suspected, the door is locked.
    Where are you? Your head hurts immensely and you still feel disconnected from
    the world. The strongbox being the only notable item in the room, you make your
    way over to the table and attempt to open it, and the moment you lay hands on
    it you are met with a voice that seems to emanate from within your own skull.
    "Who are you?"


    1. W-what? Where am I?'
